/*
 Input Pullup Serial

 This example demonstrates the use of pinMode(INPUT_PULLUP). It reads a
 digital input on pin 2 and prints the results to the serial monitor.
 Unlike pinMode(INPUT), there is no pull-down resistor necessary. An internal
 20K-ohm resistor is pulled to 5V. This configuration causes the input to
 read HIGH when the switch is open, and LOW when it is closed.

void setup() {

  //start serial connection
  Serial.begin(9600);

  //configure pin2 as an input and enable the internal pull-up resistor
  pinMode(2, INPUT_PULLUP);
}
void loop() {

  //read the pushbutton value into a variable
  int sensorVal = digitalRead(2);

  //print out the value of the pushbutton
  Serial.print("buttonState =     ");
  Serial.println(sensorVal);

  // Keep in mind the pullup means the pushbutton's
  // logic is inverted. It goes HIGH when it's open,
  // and LOW when it's pressed. Turn on pin 13 when the
  // button's pressed, and off when it's not:
  }
