/*
  This program reads the state of a pushbutton connected to pin 2.
  It uses the Arduino's internal pull-up resistor, meaning:
    - When the button is NOT pressed → the input reads HIGH (1)
    - When the button IS pressed → the input reads LOW (0)
  The LEDs connected to pins 13, 12, and 11 will turn ON or OFF 
  depending on the button state.

  // Set pins 13, 12, and 11 as outputs (for LEDs)

  pinMode(12, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(11, OUTPUT);

  // Read the pushbutton value into a variable
  int sensorVal = digitalRead(2);
  // Output the same value to the LEDs
