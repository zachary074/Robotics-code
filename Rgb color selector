/*
  RGB LED Color Mixing

  This program controls an RGB LED connected to pins 13 (Red), 11 (Green),
  and 12 (Blue) using PWM signals.

  The analogWrite() function lets you control brightness from 0–255:
    - 0 = OFF
    - 255 = FULL brightness

  By mixing different brightness levels, you can create custom colors.

int R = 13;  // Red LED pin
int G = 11;  // Green LED pin
int B = 12;  // Blue LED pin

void setup() {
  // Set each color pin as an output
  pinMode(R, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(G, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(B, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // Mix a custom color using PWM (0–255 brightness)
  analogWrite(R, 255);  // Red at full brightness
  analogWrite(G, 80);   // Green at medium brightness
  analogWrite(B, 218);  // Blue at high brightness

  // Result: pink 
}
